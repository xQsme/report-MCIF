\section{Contextualization}

In the scope of the master's degree in cybersecurity and digital forensics, students had the choice between writing a thesis, developing a project or doing an internship.
This document is the report for a curricular internship conducted at \company, where the main goal of the internship was to develop a collaborative digital forensics platform,
while also learning to develop software in an enterprise environment.

\section{Motivation}

As a computer science student, my major interest has always been software engineering, and even after completing the first year of a master's degree in a more advanced subject, 
my interests remained unchanged. Based on that interest, the opportunity to work in an enterprise environment was captivating, as I could gain experience in the 
field while also developing an interesting project to complement my education.

\section{Host Entity}

To attain an internship, an interview was conducted at ``\company``, and a 9 month long curricular internship was planned.
