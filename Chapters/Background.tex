To attain an internship, I was interviewed at ``\company``, where I was welcomed to carry out my planned 9 month long curricular internship.
The reasons behind choosing this company for the internship were related to it being, in my point of view, the most interesting place in my home town 
to begin my career as a software engineer.

This chapter gives some information about the company, like it's inception, areas of expertise, past projects developed and work conditions provided.

\section{Company Information}

It currently employs 30 High-End Professionals in several fields of expertise.

\section{Areas of Expertise}

VOID mostly functions as a company that develops software tailored to the specifications provided by the client, although 
it can also provide services in different areas like cybersecurity and digital forensics.

The company is capable of comfortably providing services in the following areas:
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Past projects}

Throughout it's 14 years of being active in the software development industry, VOID has conducted some very interesting projects, such as:
\begin{itemize}

\section{Work Environment}

VOID prides itself in providing very good conditions to it's workers, making them feel like they are at home while working,
and also to feel motivated to come to work every day. These conditions include the work environment itself, which is an open space where 
everyone can interact with each other, the ``play areas`` where people can relax while playing a game of pool or video games, the rooftop terrace where workers can relax on sunny days.
the company also makes sure nothing is missing to provide the best work environment possible by always having food and drink to all it's workers at any time.

The first impressions for someone who first walks into the space are very positive, and while being part of this family for 9 months I can also say that I had everything 
I needed to succeed in my career as a software developer while here.
