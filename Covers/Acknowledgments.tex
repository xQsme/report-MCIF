\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express appreciation for the opportunity provided by ``\company`` to work
in an enterprise environment. I'd also like to thank my faculty advisor \myProf\ 
who provided much needed help writing this report in \LaTeXe. I'm also thankful that 
Antonio Branco took time off his work to help me with so many minor details in my CSS
layouts, Jo√£o Sousa who assisted me in every step along the development, as well as everyone
else in the company who provided me with everything I needed to succeed in my internship.\\
